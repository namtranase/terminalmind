# 1. Choose a name for your package and ensure it's unique.
# 2. Create a new directory with that name.
# 3. Inside the directory, create a file named `__init__.py` to mark the directory as a Python package.
# 4. Write your Python code in subdirectories or files inside the package directory.
# 5. Install any required dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file or `setup.py`.
